# 🐸 Frog Hunter – Memory Game

Frog Hunter is a browser-based memory game developed as part of the **Foundation Project at Hack Your Future**.

The game is inspired by the classic Memory Game, where players find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time. The focus of this project is to create a smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable gameplay experience, while demonstrating incremental development and frontend-backend integration.

## 🎮 About the Game

Players interact with a grid of frog-themed cards. Key mechanics:

- Cards start face down
- Players can reveal two cards at a time
- If the cards match, they remain revealed
- If they do not match, they flip back after a short delay
- The game ends when all matching pairs are found
- A timer starts when the first card is revealed
- A counter tracks how many cards have been revealed

The game logic and interactions are designed to be clear, responsive, and easy to understand on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Approach

The game is built with:

- **HTML** - structure of the game board and interface
- **CSS** - layout, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - game logic, card flipping, and state handling
- **Express.js & SQLite** – backend API for storing and retrieving card data
- **Git & GitHub** - version control and collaboration

# Development Approach

- The project follows a sprint-based incremental approach.
- Initially, cards were hardcoded in the frontend.
- Later, the game was refactored to fetch cards from a backend API connected to a SQLite database.
- Game state (matched cards, flipped cards, timer) is managed entirely in JavaScript, keeping the backend simple and focused on data retrieval.

The structure is intentionally simple, emphasizing core concepts such as DOM manipulation, state management, and API integration.

## ⭐ Notes

- Card images and metadata are served from the backend for better scalability.
- Game logic is decoupled from data, so new cards can be added without modifying JS code.
- The frontend is responsive; the grid and cards scale with screen size, although some buttons may need minor tweaks for smaller screens.
